ACME Solutions is developing an AI-powered support assistant to enhance the quality and efficiency of customer interactions on its e-commerce platform, which specializes in electronics and gadgets. The goal is to improve customer satisfaction and engagement by automating support tasks related to product inquiries and order management.

The AI assistant will serve as the first line of support, responding to a wide range of customer queries, including product descriptions, comparisons, availability checks, alternative suggestions, and personalized recommendations. It will also manage order-related requests such as tracking shipments, updating customers on order status, accessing order history, checking return eligibility, and addressing shipping delays.

To deliver accurate and real-time responses, the assistant must seamlessly integrate with ACME’s internal databases for both product and order information. A critical requirement is that the assistant must avoid hallucinations or misinformation by limiting its answers to data verified within ACME’s systems. Inaccurate or fabricated responses are unacceptable.

The assistant must support natural, human-like conversations through capabilities such as Natural Language Understanding (NLU), context awareness, and multi-turn dialogue management. Customers should be able to ask follow-up questions, combine multiple requests into a single message, and receive personalized answers based on their profile or history.

In terms of functionality, the assistant should be capable of handling complex and nested queries — such as checking the availability of multiple items in various colors while also tracking an order — all within the same interaction. It should also provide detailed product data, including specifications, ratings, and availability, and support comparisons based on customer-defined attributes.

For order support, the assistant must retrieve order status, provide tracking numbers, estimate delivery times, confirm whether an order is eligible for return, and display past purchases. It must also manage multi-item orders by offering granular shipment updates for each product.

From a non-functional perspective, the assistant is expected to perform with high accuracy, delivering correct and consistent responses across a wide variety of user intents. It must respond quickly to ensure a seamless customer experience, maintain high availability, and scale efficiently to handle large volumes of concurrent users. Usability is also key — the interface should be intuitive, accessible, and easy to navigate.

The assistant will be deployed via the ACME web interface and should support both authenticated customers and guests. It will leverage a pre-trained NLP model, fine-tuned for the ACME domain, and must be supported by thorough documentation for architecture, deployment, and maintenance. While development may be constrained by the availability of clean, labeled training data, the expectation is that the model will improve iteratively.

This AI support assistant will align with ACME’s strategic goals of delivering superior customer experiences while optimizing internal support resources. By automating routine queries and enabling smarter, faster service, the assistant will empower customers to get the help they need — instantly, accurately, and at scale.
